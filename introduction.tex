Copper is a particularly useful metal, widely used in all manner of applications
ranging from wire (due to its conductive characteristics) to roofing to use in
alloys, such as bronze, cupronickel, aluminum bronze, red brass, and many
others.  The use of copper dates back to antiquity, and the extraction of copper
from surface minerals by smelting dates back to at least 5000 BC.
